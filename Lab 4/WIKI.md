### Shape Base Class

This will be the abstract base class. (How do you make sure a class will be abstract in C++?,How do you depict abstract in UML?) This class will house properties common to all shapes as well as public methods (accessors and mutators -only as needed) for interacting with those properties. These properties must be initialized via Shape's constructor(s).

| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Color          | All shapes will have a color property. You can represent this as three different integers (R, G, B), or a single integer with the three colors combined (24-bits minimumsuggested).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| p1             | All shapes will have an origin/location. The geometric meaning of location may vary by concrete shape, but all shapes will have at least one. This must be a floating-point value(s) (float or double) for a 2-D Cartesian system. I suggest you use aMatrixobject to store your coordinates. To be ready for future labs, I suggest you actually use a 4×1 Matrix (fourrows, one column). The first row will be the X value, the second Y,the third Z,and the fourthto 1.0.. |

| Constructors        | Initialize properties that reside in Shape.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Copy Constructor    | Copy Shape's properties during a copy operation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Destructor          | Probably no work for it in Shape, but good to put in just in case (and make virtual -why?).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Assignment operator | This will handle assignment of Shape's properties only. Since Shape is abstract, this method should never be called by “users.” See note below.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| draw                | This will be the method called to draw the shape. Since Shape itself is abstract, we do not have anything for this method to do in the base class, thus, it will likely be “pure virtual.” Alternatively, you could make this method just virtual, and chain to it from over-ridden versions in order to set the color or other properties prior to the concrete shape drawing itself. This method must accept a 'GraphicsContext*' in order to know where to draw the shape.                                 |
| out                 | This method will be like the Matrix::out method. It will accept a std::ostream& and dump the Shape properties to theostream. Note, this method should be virtual, meaning the derived class (concrete) shape's version will get called first. Be sure to chain to this version to have Shape dump its own properties, that is, for example, if Line's out method is called, Line's out should call Shape's out method to output Shape's properties, and then Line's out should only output Line's properties. |
| in                  | This is the counterpart to out, and will accept a std::istream&. It will be used to read shape properties from a text file. The format will be whatever you specified for out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| clone               | This is the “virtual constructor” that will be discussed in lecture. You will need this to make copies of Shapes. Since Shape will be abstract, this method should be pure virtual.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

### Concrete Shape Classes

| **Class Name** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Line           | This will be the second-simplest of the concrete shape classes. We need to add an additional property for the other end of the line in addition to issues mentioned for Point. If you used a Matrix to store the “origin” in Shape, can you resize it to hold the endpoint for the line? You could add a second column. |
| Triangle       | For a triangle, will need to be sure we store **all three coordinates** for thevertices, and have at least one constructor that can accept all three coordinates (individually and/or as a Matrix). Keep in mind that Shape already possesses one coordinate pair.                                                      |

### Optional Shapes

| **Class Name** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Circle         | Now we need to decide the geometric interpretation of the origin being held by the Shape class. In addition, how do we specify the circle -radius, diameter? Actually, a circle will turn out to be somewhat difficult to deal with later on when we are performing transformations. If you wish circle to work with 2D transformations, you will likely want to represent the circle as an origin and a point on the circle.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Rectangle      | While we have a number of options for constructing the rectangle in terms of what information we pass to the constructor (origin, height and width; origin and opposite corner) we will need to be sure we storeallfourcoordinatepairsfor the corners, and have at least one constructor that can accept all four coordinatepairs. This is necessary for our Rectangle to work properly later on when we are doing transformations.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Polygon        | This one will be a bit tricky. Our polygon can have any number ofvertices, so the question becomes how do we store data of unknown length? In addition, how do we construct it in the first place. As a guide, consider how you draw a polygon in a typical drawing program. Each mouse-click creates a new vertex until entry is done. You will need your Polygon to behave similarly. For example, the constructor could establish the origin/location, and then an additional method (addVertex()?) should add each additional vertex to completely specify the polygon. Definitely worth extra credit... |

### Shape Container

| **Method**   | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Constructors | No-argument -creates a default image (empty, containing no shapes)Copy -Creates a duplicate image from one that already exists; the newly-created image contains deep copies of the earlier image's shapes.                                                      |
| Destructor   | Delete all the shape objects from the container (the STL destructor will not do this automatically since it only holds pointers to the shapes unless you use std::unique_ptr) and delete all other dynamic objects.                                              |
| operator=    | Assigns an image to contain the same shapes as another image. The image object must first completely destroy its current collection of shapes, and then create deep copies of the shapes it is being assigned from the other image. Be aware of self-assignment. |
| add          | Add a new shape (via a pointer) to the container.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| draw         | Ask all the shapes to draw themselves by iterating through the image's collection of shapes, and invoking each shape's draw() method via the pointer. This method will need to accept aGraphicsContext*.                                                         |
| out          | Output all the shapes to anostream(console or data file). This routine will need to accept anostream&.                                                                                                                                                           |
| in           | Read a set of shapes from anistream(console or data file). This routine will need to accept anistream&.                                                                                                                                                          |
| erase        | Remove all the shapes from an image and return any dynamic memory they occupy.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
