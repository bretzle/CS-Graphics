# Assignment

Write a C++ console program that will:

- accept a filename of an ASCII STL file via the command line
- open and read file (recommend reading line-by-line using getline)
- identify each facet, and print the coordinates of each of its vertices to the console, readable and formatted
- summarize contents
  - thenumber of facetsin the file
  - the min and max of the x, y, and z coordinates
- No need to store vertices, etc â€“we will do that later

The program must be a quality, commented implementation commensurate with your programming experience.  The implementation must be structured (not all code in main) aswe may reuse some of this code later.  Itmay be in single .cpp source file, or multiplesource files.

See:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)

A sample ASCII STL file will be provided for testing your program, but I suggesting testing with other files to ensure a robust implementation.
